    <h1>Self-Evaluation Report</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>L&M Webshop Website is accessible to it users in terms of server uptime and mobile responsiveness. 
            It ensures its visitors don’t get an error trying to load our site and can handle different screen 
            sizes. Although being existent in the improvement plan, the website is currently not accessible for 
            people with some disabilities and not available in all languages. The website provides its customers 
            a good level of clarity and relevancy as they are keys of usability, avoids irrelevant pictures and 
            nonsensical content. The tables and sections are constructed by focusing and understanding its visitors 
            needs about the structure and the content of the website which is the core of usability. </p>

    <h2>Accessibility Highlights </h2>
        <p>The most relevant guidelines are Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives and Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable as both 
           critically affect the accessibility of the content thus the understanding of it.  Text alternatives ensure 
           the semantic integrity of the website in case a non-text content is not accessible for specific scenarios. 
           Guideline 1.4 is key for accessibility for people who have physical needs different from the majority as it 
           focuses on contrast and audio of the website. The website provides the same accessibility requirements, for 
           example, for those with color blindness by ensuring the contrast level is sufficient but lacks the properties 
           to provide the same level of accessibility with those that require audio for example. </p>

        <caption><h2>Appendix A</h2></caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><br>Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed 
            into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.</td>
        <td>The website compiles with the guideline as it provides text alternatives written as descriptive identification
            for images to ensure that if a non-text content cannot be displayed, it does not critically affect the understanding
            of the content.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><br>Guideline 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without
             losing information or structure.</td>
        <td>The web page can be printed without losing any content and has a print style with almost the same layout as the website.
             However, the page layout should be improved to present a better quality and understandable content. For example, interactive
             parts are planned to be removed because they are not meaningful in pdf format, therefore we partially meet the requirements
             of this guideline. The website is responsive to different screen sizes such as on different mobile phones and the comprehensibility
             of the content is preserved.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><br>Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.</td>
        <td><br>1.4.1 Use of Color: The features of the websites are distinguishable because the titles containing the links in the navigation bar and 
            in the contact section are highlighted and underlined when hovered over them. It compiles with the specific requirement for color to be 
            not used as the only visual means of indicating an action or distinguishing a visual element as links are also underlined when hovered 
            or clicked. To shadow out that explanation can be seen when the abbreviations are emphasized, we used underlines rather than color.
            <br>1.4.2 Audio Control: Our web page does not contain any audio, thus it does not satisfy this guideline.
            <br>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):The text contrast should at least be 4:5:1. Our website consists color combinations such as black on #DEE0E3 in our navigation bar with
            the ratio 1.32:1 which is less than required. Other examples are:use of black on #ADD8E6 when hovered on links with a convenient ratio of  13.74:1 ; 
            using #C2C2C2 on white for placeholders of an input element with a failing ratio of 1.94:1. The ratios are calculated with the website: 
            <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker">Contrast Checker</a> .
            
            <br>1.4.4 Resize text: The text does not lose its functionality or visibility when resized up to 200%.
            <br>1.4.5 Images of Text: No images were used instead of text anywhere on this website.
            <br>1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced): The contrast ratio is not always sufficient. See the contrast ratios at 1.4.3.
            <br>1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio: Not applicable since no audio is used on the website. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.</td>
        <td><br>2.1.1 Keyboard: A customer can reach and explore the content of the website only with the keyboard. It is possible to use the navigation 
            bar, fill out the forms, or even get directed to make a phone call to the call center or to your mailbox to send an e-mail with the tab and enter keys.
            <br>2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: The focus can be moved by moving to the next element by using tab. Any keyboard trap is not observed. 
            <br>2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception): The web page does not require specific timings for individual keystrokes.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Guideline 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.</td>
        <td><br>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks: This guideline does not cover this website as it contains only one web page. 
            <br>2.4.2 Page Titled: The titles describe topic and purpose about the related content. 
            <br>2.4.3 Focus Order: The interactive elements (form elements) follows sequences and relationships within the content and the website can be navigated sequentially. 
            <br>2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context): The link text in the navigation bar (“Home, Products, Best Sellers, Contact us.. ”) is descriptive in terms of understanding the determined purpose of the link. 
            <br>2.4.5Multiple Ways: A navigation bar is provided in the home page so more than one way is available to locate a Web page. 
            <br>2.4.6Headings and Labels: Headings and labels of form elements describe topic or purpose of action.
            <br>2.4.7Focus Visible: When they get focus, the colors of the boxes of the form elements change. Links are also highlighted and underlined when hovered.
            <br>2.4.8Location: It is not existent in the website. 
            <br>2.4.9Link Purpose (Link Only): The links are provided with additional explanation such as in the contact us section.</td>

                -2 for bad style of wrapping everything in $(document).ready() call
                -2 for nonsensical constructs in item1() and item2() functions, instead of 
                returning functions you could just put the anonymous function in the .click() call directly

                -2 for inconsistent use of whitespace
